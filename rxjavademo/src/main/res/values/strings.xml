    <string name="rx_intro">ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.  It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.</string>
